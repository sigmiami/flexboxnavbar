responsive flexbox nav bar by sigmiami

hey what's up guys I noticed there weren't many responsive 
flexbox nav bar examples out there so I made one. 
rather than using the usual font awesome icons or
three spans for the hamburger menu (trigram) and 
X to close the menu, I used unicode characters 
which you can still style and add transitions to 
with css...  hope this helps... you can find me
on Instagram at sigmiami...
